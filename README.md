# `gen_batch`

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rackerlabs/gen_batch.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rackerlabs/gen_batch)

This project provides a batch job runner for Erlang. Jobs are defined in terms
of the `gen_batch` behaviour, specified in `gen_batch.erl`. The callbacks are
intended to give caller insight into and control over the workflow of the batch
job.

Please see the files in `test/` for examples.
